## Welcome to 1km

The original goal of 1 Kilometer was to provide a solution to help find local protests during Israel's 2nd lockdown, which limited the protesting radius to 1km from your home.  
Since then the project grew bigger, and now our goal is to serve as the virual homepage for the protest movement in Israel. 

**Want to help?** Check out our [up for grabs](https://github.com/guytepper/1km.co.il/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22) list, fork the repo and submit a PR!  
We welcome anyone, and would appreciate any help. 
If you have an installation issues, got a question or just want to chat, join our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/VuzxwKN) :)

## Introduction

- A solid knowledge of (and a desire to) React is recommended before dwelling into the code.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is here to keep our the data and host our assets.
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) ensures we have a single source of truth - not so obvious these days.   
- We color our protest signs with [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/).

## Installation

- Fork the repository.
- Install dependencies using `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start` and start coding!
